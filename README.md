# Advent-of-Code-2023
This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that can be done in any language or platform. Every day from December 1st through 25, at midnight EST a new challenge is published.

My implementation is in JavaScript. To run a solution, simply run the file in nodeJs.
